    <p>When we talk about family!!!!</p>
    <p><i>To begin with,,,,, I am Abenaitwe Shivan and here i am as a student of
         Bugema University doing Bachelors of science in software Engineering </i></p>
         <p><i>In my family being the first and last born, i was brought up in a way that i have to do everything for myself not like how people think that last borns behave,
             My Dad used to tell me each day that passes "Shivan my daughter, the world is a mess out there so you have to learn to live by yourself." he didnt just say these words out of anger or what but he knew what
              he was meaning and as an old person, he perhaps had experience in what he was saying</i></p>
              <p>Meet my elder sister who is the rollmodel of the family, she was brought up well and her personality is a testament to her authenticity, 
                She encourages us to stay true to ourselves and her mantra is that "BE YOURSELF AND THE WORLD WILL LOVE YOU FOR IT" </p>
